## Projects

### Project 1: [Batch Loading with Gmail API, Google Sheets API, and Selenium](link-to-project)

- Description:
  - This project is a script designed to automate the daily reporting update process. It utilizes Selenium and the Gmail API to extract data from specified emails when the script is executed. Once the data is extracted, it is cleaned with Pandas and Numpy then batch-loaded into a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API. This streamlines the process of collecting and organizing data from manually logging into the reporting platform and email sources, providing a convenient and efficient solution for data management.
- Technologies used:
  - Python (Pandas & Numpy)
  - Gmail API
  - Google Sheets API
  - Selenium
